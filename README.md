# Github Repository Exploration

Third installation in React+d3 demos.


This exercise demonstrates the use of D3 in conjunction with react. Because this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), you'll need to run `npm install` inside the project directory to install necessary packages. Then start your server by running `npm start`.

The site is live [HERE](https://github-reactd3.herokuapp.com/)

A visualization tool to explore Github repositories and pull down data/documents via githubAPI.

This project serves as the third segment in order to gain a better understanding and ultimately coding fluidity for creating advance interactive visualizations.
